# UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis Project 

## Overview
This project analyzes local authority greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the UK using open government datasets. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, trends, and regional variations in emissions from 2005 to 2022, aiming to provide actionable insights for sustainability efforts. The project employs data preprocessing, visualization, and exploratory data analysis techniques.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Source:** UK government-published greenhouse gas emissions dataset (2005-2022).
- **Data Insights:** Regional and sectoral emissions trends with a focus on sustainability.
- **Visualization:** Comprehensive visualizations to highlight key patterns and trends.
- **Methodology:** A detailed process of data preparation, feature selection, and analysis.
